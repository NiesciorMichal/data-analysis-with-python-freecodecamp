# Medical Data Visualiser  

[Medical Data Visualiser Certification Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer)  

### Data description  

The rows in the dataset represent patients and the columns represent information like body measurements, results from various blood tests, and lifestyle choices. You will use the dataset to explore the relationship between cardiac disease, body measurements, blood markers, and lifestyle choices.  

### Files description  
- **medical_examination.csv** - Dataset
- **medical_data_visualizer.py** script for creating catplot (Seaborn) like the one in examples/Figure_1.png and heatmap (Seaborn)  
- **main.py** - call the functions of *medical_data_visualizer.py* and unit tests from *test_module.py*  
- **medical_notebook.ipynb** - sandbox (Jupyter) to test the Dataframes and Visualization underway

This project is in progress. I managed to output the first visualization: *catplot.png*  
The commented numbers in the *medical_data_visualizer.py* script are the **Instructions** from [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/medical-data-visualizer).
